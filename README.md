# communitybuild-fullstack
Community building is a muilti chat web application. Used using React and Firebase.
Back then, I used React-Firebase to be authorized by Google-authors, and it was very secure especially for unauthorized users.
I have also improved the channel section to add new channels and connect with these channels.
I have used the firestore to store all messages distributed in channels or in the community.
And surely our site will be protected under google-firebase security so no worries about security.
Features
Channels or messages are stored on the firestore website and are immediately accessible through our app.
I used the react-router-dom to store server side load or upgrade. this function improves the redirect speed from one part to another without updating from the server side makes life easier, saves a lot of time and is quick to change without loading or refining the entire page.
Our data will be real-time, if changes in messages or channels will automatically change in our app in real time there is no need to update our page. the app will react as if you used it on Desktop or mobile devices it offers the same thing.
